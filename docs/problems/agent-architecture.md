# Agent Architecture

What agents exist, what authority do they have, and how do they interact?

## The dual security context

Konflux is a CI/CD system. Agents operating on it have two distinct security responsibilities:

1. **Protecting the system itself** — agents reviewing changes to Konflux components (controllers, operators, services) need to guard against threats to the platform
2. **Protecting content passing through the system** — agents reviewing pipeline definitions, build configurations, and release policies need to guard against threats that would affect Konflux users

These may require different agent specializations with different domain knowledge.

## Possible agent roles

### Implementation agent

Writes code to address an issue. This is the most mature capability of current AI coding tools.

- **Authority:** Create branches, push commits, open PRs
- **Does not have:** Merge authority, ability to approve its own PRs

### Review agent

Reviews PRs for correctness, style, test coverage, and alignment with intent.

- **Authority:** Comment on PRs, request changes, approve (for non-guarded paths)
- **Considerations:** Should multiple review agents with different specializations each weigh in? (See security review agents below.)

### Security review agents

Specialized agents focused on security concerns. Possibly multiple sub-agents:

- **Injection defense agent** — specifically looks for prompt injection attempts in PRs
- **RBAC/permissions agent** — reviews changes that affect authorization and access control
- **Supply chain agent** — evaluates dependency changes and build pipeline modifications
- **CI/CD content agent** — reviews Tekton pipeline definitions and build configs for security issues that would affect users

### Triage agent

Processes incoming issues, classifies severity and scope, routes to appropriate priority level.

- **Authority:** Label issues, assign priority, link related issues
- **Considerations:** Must be hardened against prompt injection in issue text

### Backlog/priority agent

Determines what should be worked on next based on priority, urgency, and available capacity.

- **Authority:** Assign work to implementation agents, reorder priority
- **Considerations:** Needs access to strategic intent to make good decisions

### Quality/drift detection agent

Monitors aggregate code quality trends over time. Not per-PR, but per-repo over weeks/months.

- **Authority:** Open issues when trends are concerning, flag for human review
- **Does not have:** Ability to block merges (that's the review agent's job)

## Interaction patterns

### Pipeline model

Agents form a pipeline: triage -> prioritize -> implement -> review -> merge. Each stage hands off to the next.

**Pros:** Simple, clear authority boundaries.
**Cons:** Rigid. Doesn't handle iteration well (review agent requests changes, implementation agent needs to respond).

### Collaborative model

Agents interact more fluidly — a review agent can directly ask an implementation agent for changes, a security agent can veto a review agent's approval.

**Pros:** More natural, handles iteration.
**Cons:** Complex coordination. Risk of deadlocks or circular escalation.

### Hierarchical model

A coordinating agent orchestrates the others, making final decisions when sub-agents disagree.

**Pros:** Clear decision authority. Can break deadlocks.
**Cons:** Single point of failure. The coordinator becomes the most attractive attack target.

## Open questions

- Should agents be stateless (fresh context per task) or stateful (accumulated knowledge of the codebase)?
- How do agents communicate? Through GitHub (comments, labels, status checks) or through a separate coordination layer?
- What happens when agents disagree? (Security agent says no, review agent says yes.)
- Should there be one instance of each agent type per repo, per org, or shared?
- How do we prevent agent-to-agent prompt injection? (A compromised implementation agent crafting PR content to manipulate the review agent.)
- What's the right model for agent identity? Do agents act as GitHub bot accounts? As app installations?
- How do we test agent behavior? Can we simulate adversarial scenarios in a sandbox?
